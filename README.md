**iREST** will be a game changer for those who want to quickly develop API prototypes and want to test all the scenarios during integration in minimum time and that is too without even knowing or writing a single line of code. It would save lot of time of developers/consumers who spent or wait longer time for APIs to be ready on server and can also reduce QA iterations by testing all things in advance.  

## Getting Started

### ‚è≥ Installation

Install iREST with this **Quickstart** command to create a iREST project on your machine:

- Use **NPX** to install the iREST project (recommended). (Install NPX with this command - npm install -g npx).

```bash
npx irest <my-app>
```

**or**

- Use npm to install the iREST project.

```bash
npm install -g irest
```
```bash
irest <my-app>
```
This command generates a brand new project with <my-app> name on your machine. This command installs **iREST** using a **SQLite** database which is used for prototyping in development.

  <br>
  
**Run iREST on your machine**
  - Go to your newly created app and run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```  
This command will run the iREST instance on your machine and open a new browser tab in which iREST would be running.
  
  
Enjoy and start playing with **iREST** üéâ
